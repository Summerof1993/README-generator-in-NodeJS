# README generator in Node.JS

## Description

The motivation behind this README generator was to automate the creation of a professional README
for future projects using the Command Line Interface (CLI). I used inquirer to ask the user
questions about their projects and have access to the response objects as well as other built-in Node.JS
packages such as "FS" and leveraged modularization to seperate files based on function. 

## Installation

The steps required to use this APP is to download the files, open them in the node.js environment, 
and use the command line interface (CLI) to start the program. You start the program by installing any
programs/packages in the package.json file by using the following CLI command: "npm i". 
Then you would start the program by typing the following CLI command: "node index.js". You will
then be prompted to answer questions about your project. When you are finished, a sampleRADME.md file will
populate with your input.
